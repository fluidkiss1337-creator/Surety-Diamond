## The Problem

Enterprise supply chain finance platforms process billions in cross-border payments across 80+ countries and 30+ currencies. Every transaction touches a web of overlapping regulatory regimes — FATF, OFAC, 6AMLD, FATCA, CRS, MiCA — each with its own KYC requirements, sanctions lists, tax withholding rules, and reporting obligations.

The compliance burden is staggering:

- **32+ compliance checks per transaction** across multiple jurisdictions
- **Double-factoring fraud** — the same invoice pledged to multiple financiers
- **Sanctions violations** carrying criminal penalties and reputational collapse
- **Tax authority reporting** across FATCA and CRS with conflicting classification schemes
- **Audit trail requirements** that demand tamper-proof, regulator-accessible records

Traditional compliance stacks are fragmented, manual, and brittle. They don't scale. They don't compose. They can't be audited on-chain.

**We were asked to fix that.**

## What We Built

Surety Diamond is a modular, upgradeable smart contract system that moves compliance infrastructure on-chain using the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**. Every compliance domain — KYC, AML, sanctions, tax, invoicing, audit — lives in its own independently upgradeable facet, sharing unified storage through a single proxy.

| **Facets** | 13 — each a self-contained compliance domain |
| **Function Selectors** | 103 routed through the diamond proxy |
| **Events** | 59 — every state change emits an auditable record |
| **Interfaces** | 14 — full NatSpec-documented API surface |
| **Role Types** | 15 — granular RBAC from admin to buyer |
| **Test Files** | 17 — unit, integration, fuzz, and selector verification |
| **Production Solidity** | 4,772 lines |
| **Sanctions Lists** | 6 — OFAC SDN, OFAC Consolidated, UN SC, EU, UK HMT, Custom |
| **KYC Tiers** | 5 — None through Institutional |
| **Upgrade Timelock** | 48 hours mandatory — no unilateral changes |

## Compliance Domains

### KYC — Know Your Customer

FATF-aligned verification across five tiers (BASIC through INSTITUTIONAL). Merkle-proof document verification. PEP detection. Auto-expiry at 365 days with renewal workflows. Full lifecycle tracking: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, EXPIRED, SUSPENDED, UNDER_REVIEW.

### AML — Anti-Money Laundering

Real-time transaction risk scoring on a 0-1000 scale. Automatic SAR filing for high-risk transactions exceeding $10,000. PEP involvement escalates risk by +200 points. Unverified entities add +300. Large transactions add +100. Entity-level risk profiles with escalation support.

### Sanctions Screening

Gas-efficient Merkle-proof verification against six global sanctions lists. Potential match detection at 75% confidence. False positive clearance with documented reasons. Oracle-integrated list root updates. Covers OFAC SDN, OFAC Consolidated, UN Security Council, EU Consolidated, UK HMT, and custom lists.

### Invoice Registry & Supply Chain Finance

On-chain invoice registration with cryptographic double-factoring prevention. ECDSA signature verification for seller/buyer attestation. Factoring agreement lifecycle from PENDING through SETTLED or DEFAULTED. Advance rates enforced at 1-95%. Payment recording and dispute handling.

### FATCA/CRS — International Tax Compliance

Eight FATCA classification types. Six CRS entity categories. Tax form management (W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-9, W-8IMY) with jurisdiction-specific expiry. Withholding rate assessment (US 30%, backup 24%). Cross-border reporting obligation tracking with configurable thresholds.

### Multi-Jurisdiction Routing

Per-jurisdiction compliance configuration: minimum KYC levels, transaction limits, enhanced due diligence thresholds, withholding rates. Cross-border pair assessment. Ability to block specific jurisdiction pairs outright.

### Audit Trail

Hash-chained immutable log with 19 event types spanning KYC, AML, sanctions, invoicing, tax, and system operations. Chain verification for tamper detection. Entity-level audit retrieval with time and event-type filtering. Built for regulator inspection.

## Security Architecture

This system protects high-value financial flows. Security is not an afterthought — it's a design constraint.

**Upgrade Governance** — 48-hour mandatory timelock on all diamond cuts. Multi-sig approval with configurable threshold. Pre-upgrade snapshots for rollback reference. Storage layout validation before execution.

**Rate Limiting** — Per-selector, per-address sliding window limits on sensitive operations. Configurable call caps and time windows.

**Circuit Breaker** — Auto-pause when security incidents exceed threshold within a configured window. Prevents cascade failures during active attack.

**Threat Registry** — Severity-graded threat indicators (LOW through CRITICAL). CRITICAL incidents auto-block offending addresses. Security incident history per entity.

**Access Control** — 15 role types with hierarchical admin structure. Every state-changing function is role-gated. Bootstrap bypass is single-use during initialization only.

**Reentrancy Protection** — Guard on all sensitive state-changing operations.

**Custom Errors** — Gas-efficient revert handling. No string messages.

## Regulatory Coverage

| Region | Frameworks Addressed |
| --- | --- |
| **United States** | Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), USA PATRIOT Act (Sections 312, 319), OFAC Sanctions Programs, FATCA |
| **European Union** | MiCA, 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD), GDPR considerations |
| **United Kingdom** | HM Treasury Financial Sanctions |
| **Global** | FATF Recommendations, UN Security Council Sanctions, Basel III/IV Capital Requirements, CRS |

## Why Diamond Standard

The EIP-2535 Diamond pattern was chosen deliberately. Compliance requirements change with every regulatory update, sanctions designation, and jurisdictional shift. A monolithic contract cannot keep pace.

- **Modular upgrades** — Update AML scoring without touching KYC or sanctions
- **No size ceiling** — 13 facets worth of compliance logic would exceed the 24KB contract limit many times over
- **Granular access control** — Different permission models per compliance domain
- **Regulator introspection** — DiamondLoupe provides full on-chain transparency into system capabilities
- **Storage efficiency** — Single shared storage slot eliminates cross-contract coordination

---
